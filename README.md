goFrankNet
==========

FrankNet implemented in Golang
Currently working with FrankNet v.5A

FrankCLI is a implementation that uses the package 
"github.com/Zephyyrr/goFrankNet/frank" package to provide a cli interface.
It also has the option of a http server with the additional 
option of a non-interactive mode, to run on a public webpage.

If anyone wants to make their own application, 
it is the "frank" package that is of interest.
